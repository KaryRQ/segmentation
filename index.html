<h2>First Approach of the Project</h2>
<span>We had previous research of an agency where 36 profiles were established, all of them with similar characteristics, so the objective was to reduce to a considerable amount and with the indispensable characteristics for each area that will use these profiles.</span>

<h2>Interviews</h2>
<span>After analyzing the information, interviews were conducted with the different areas that sent information to users. It was important to know the methodology they used to send the information, at that time it was detected that there was no order between areas for sending information.

	In these interviews, each of them also expressed the needs to be covered with this segmentation and how they would like to work with the other areas involved.</span>

<h2>Project Development</h2>
<span>Once the information has been compiled, work begins with the data found both from interviews and previous research. Weekly meetings are held with those involved so that they can give feedback on the segments that are being created week by week so that with all this new information the number of segments and information obtained can be reduced.</span>

<h2>Final Segmentation</h2>
<span>After doing several work sessions with the areas involved and improving the features that each one needed, we were able to end up with 4 profiles with all the requirements of each area for sending information to end users.</span>

<h2>Mailing Map</h2>
<span>Once the segments were defined, we were able to propose a map of mailings between the areas so that the user would not receive duplicate information or information that was not of value to him, with all this we reduced by 18% the calls to the call center with complaints from customers to request their cancellation of mailings and increased the opening of these mailings.</span>
